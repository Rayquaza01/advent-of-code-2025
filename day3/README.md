This was a nice and simple one.

For part 1, it was just run find max twice. Once, with the last battery excluded, and once again with the remaining batteries after the highest. Since it only needs to be done twice, I just duplicated the code.

For part 2, you need to do it 12 times. So, I un-duplicated the code and put it in a loop.

My part 2 solution is better: it's shorter by literally one token, and it can solve part 1, too. (Part 1 is just part 2 with a limit of 2 instead of 12.) There is basically no performance difference. In fact, the first time I timed them, part 2 ran faster than part 1 lol!
