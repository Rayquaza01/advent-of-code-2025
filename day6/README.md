Against my better judgement, I decided to do this one at midnight.

Part 1 was simple enough. It's just a really weird way of reading the input data.

Part 2 wants you to transpose a string. That's crazy. I spent way too long fiddling with it before I just looked up a matrix transpose algorithm. (I also ran into an issue where my editor's trim trailing whitespace function burned me.) Once I transposed the text grid, I converted it back to a string, and it's the same problem as part 1, just formatted a little differently.
